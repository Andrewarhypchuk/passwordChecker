In this task, I have fulfilled all the requirements that were specified. I used TypeScript and implemented Redux to manage the state of the password and its level. Also, I used custom hooks for useSelector and useDispatch. The password is stored in local storage to retain the entered data after page reload. The styling is implemented at a basic level because of task size.
